This is the VBA behind an Excel Chart and report.

I run weekly reports that are feed into an Excel spreedsheet to produce charts that compare each hull. The charts can be baselined to the BT or AT date depending on the audence of the exported chart. This is VBA and the file here is saved as VB to enable text highlighting.
